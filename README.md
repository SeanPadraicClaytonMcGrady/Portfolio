Welcome to my portfolio! These are some sample projects. They demonstrate a variety of data-driven skills.

- I use SQL to answer business inquiries: Which bands should we sign onto our music platform, and why? Should we only purchase single tracks from record labels, or full albums?
- I use Python to investigate injuries taken from OSHA's public database (2015-2017): What are the top injuries to focus on? What is the % chance a construction worker gets X injury? And more!
- I use Tableau to illustrate discoveries about those injuries: How do those injuries accrue over time? What are their conditions? How should we approach reducing them?
- I made a custom spam filter. It's something we take for granted-- but there's actually some considerable statistics behind it, and it's a service we can't live without.
- I use Z-Scores to find the best market to invest in.

Also included on my Github profile is another repository called "Minimum Viable Projects." These are further proof of experience & project completion. Feel free to explore for a sense of how I operate. Link below.
