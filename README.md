Welcome to my portfolio! These are projects I'm happy to showcase. They demonstrate a variety of data-driven skills.

- I use SQL to answer business inquiries: Which bands should we sign onto our music platform, and why? Should we only purchase single tracks from record labels, or full albums?
- I use Python to investigate injuries taken from OSHA's public database (2015-2017): What are the top injuries to focus on? What is the % chance a construction worker gets X injury? And more!
- I use Tableau to illustrate discoveries about those injuries: How do those injuries accrue over time? What are their conditions? How should we approach reducing them?

These projects give a great opportunity to discuss data analysis, and whether we ought to work together.

Also included on my Github profile is another repository called "Minimum Viable Projects." These are proof of experience & project completion. Feel free to explore for a sense of how I operate.

However, it's intended that we focus on the three projects in Portfolio for our discussion. These are the most recent in my memory, and I'm passionate about them.

Access the projects above by clicking on their files. For the Tableau illustrations of the OSHA construction injury data, follow the link below.
